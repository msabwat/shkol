Manifesto
=========

In the era of "AI", the education system is becoming more and more obsolete.

Some tasks can be automated, among them evaluating batches of 20 to 30 copies per homework.

This will allow teachers to become facilitators become they won't be limited by the number of copies they can correct.

This is a very early stage proof of concept using n8n.
